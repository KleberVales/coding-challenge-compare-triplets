# coding-challenge-compare-triplets

The challenge "Compare the Triplets" involves comparing two triplets of integers that represent scores given to Alice and Bob in three categories: clarity, originality, and difficulty. Here's a concise description:

## Problem Statement:

You are given two triplets:

- a = [a[0], a[1], a[2]] for Alice's scores.
- b = [b[0], b[1], b[2]] for Bob's scores.

For each category i:

- If a[i] > b[i], Alice earns 1 point.
- If a[i] < b[i], Bob earns 1 point.
- If a[i] == b[i], no points are awarded.
